# Star-Run
iOS Game Application

This code was developed using objective C and was published in the app store.

The game is designed so that the user controls a rocket going through an asteroid obstacle course. The way the asteroids are arranged is randomized so that the pattern cannot be memorized. The score is calculated by every second the user stays alive.
